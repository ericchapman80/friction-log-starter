# 🧱 Developer Experience Friction Log

Welcome to the **Developer Experience Friction Log**, part of our larger initiative to create a **delightful, productive, and modern engineering environment** for all teams.

## 🎯 Purpose

This friction log serves as a **transparent, ongoing record** of challenges that engineers encounter across our development ecosystem. Inspired by open source best practices, this log helps us:

- Identify and surface pain points experienced by developers
- Encourage open discussion and context sharing across teams
- Quantify and prioritize friction points in our weekly DevEx Advisory reviews
- Collaborate with the right teams to **remove, reduce, or resolve friction**

This is **not** about blame — it's about making our platform better for everyone.

## 🙋‍♀️ How to Participate

We want **every engineer** to feel empowered to raise concerns — whether you're onboarding a new service, debugging flaky pipelines, requesting access to tools, or working around documentation gaps.

### 📝 To Log a New Friction Point

1. **Create a new GitHub Issue** in this repo
2. Use the `Friction Log` issue template (or copy the format below)
3. Be clear and specific — include:
   - What happened?
   - What did you expect?
   - How did it affect your productivity?
   - Any workarounds or failed attempts?

> The more context, the better we can advocate and prioritize.

### 💬 To Contribute to a Discussion

- Comment on existing issues with:
  - Your own experiences or impact
  - Questions for clarity
  - Ideas for potential solutions

## 🧩 Friction Issue Template

```
### 😖 What’s the friction?

_Describe what’s hard, broken, missing, or confusing._

### 📍 Where did this happen?

_Tool, repo, system, team, etc._

### 🧠 Workarounds or mitigation?

_Did you find a workaround? What failed?_

### ⏱️ Time lost or productivity impact

_Estimate (if known)._

### 💡 Any suggestions?
```

## 🚀 What Happens Next

- All submissions are reviewed by the **DevEx Technical Advisory Group** during our weekly meeting
- Items will be:
  - Clarified if needed
  - Tagged by category (e.g. pipelines, access, onboarding, tooling)
  - Prioritized by impact and effort
- We will track status updates and resolutions transparently via GitHub

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- We value **engineer experience as a product**
- Friction is often a signal, not a failure
- Collaboration and empathy across teams will help us build something great
- This log is a **safe space** — all constructive feedback is welcome

## ❤️ Part of Our DevEx Vision

This effort is one component of our broader **Developer Experience initiative**, which is focused on:

- Reducing delivery, access, and cognitive friction
- Shortening time to onboarding and flow
- Enabling modern tools, documentation, and support
- Building a world-class environment to **attract and retain top talent**

Thanks for being part of the journey to make our engineering experience the best it can be 🚀
