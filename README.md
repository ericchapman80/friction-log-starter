# 🧱 Developer Experience Friction Log

Welcome to the **Developer Experience Friction Log**, part of our larger initiative to create a **delightful, productive, and modern engineering environment** for all teams.

## 🎯 Purpose

This friction log serves as a **transparent, ongoing record** of challenges that engineers encounter across our development ecosystem. Inspired by open source best practices, this log helps us:

- Identify and surface pain points experienced by developers
- Encourage open discussion and context sharing across teams
- Quantify and prioritize friction points
- Collaborate with the right teams to **remove, reduce, or resolve friction**

This is **not** about blame — it's about making our platform better for everyone.

## 🙋‍♀️ How to Participate

We want **every engineer** to feel empowered to raise concerns — whether you're onboarding a new service, debugging pipelines / workflows, requesting access to tools, or working around documentation gaps.

### 🔄 Workflow Summary:
1. **Start with a Discussion** for open feedback.
2. **We'll convert it to an Issue** if it's actionable.
3. **We tag and track issues** in the friction log.

Your contributions help improve developer experience for everyone—thank you!

### 🗣️ Start a Discussion
If you're experiencing a developer friction—or just want to share a pain point, start a new [Discussion](https://github.com/ericchapman80/friction-log-starter/discussions) under the **Frictions** category. This allows for open-ended conversation, collaborative brainstorming, and community voting.

- Use a descriptive title (e.g., "Long CI/CD Times on Small Changes")
- Include context (what you were trying to do, expected behavior, what got in your way)
- Others can jump in, add details, or propose solutions

Once a friction is well-understood, we may convert the discussion into a formal GitHub Issue (Friction Log) for tracking and resolution.

### 📝 To Log a New Friction Point

If you already know the friction and want to log it formally:

1. [Create a new Friction Log issue using this direct link](https://github.com/ericchapman80/friction-log-starter/issues/new?template=friction_log.md&title=%5BFriction%5D%20<short%20summary>)
   - This will open a new GitHub issue, pre-filled with the Friction Log template.
2. Alternatively, go to the Issues tab and click "New Issue," then select the `Friction Log` template.
3. Be clear and specific — include:
   - What happened?
   - What did you expect?
   - How did it affect your productivity?
   - Any workarounds or failed attempts?

> The more context, the better we can advocate and prioritize.

### 💬 To Contribute to a Discussion

- Comment on existing issues with:
  - Your own experiences or impact
  - Questions for clarity
  - Ideas for potential solutions

## 🧩 Friction Issue Template

```
### 😖 What’s the friction?

_Describe what’s hard, broken, missing, or confusing._

### 📍 Where did this happen?

_Tool, repo, system, team, etc._

### 🧠 Workarounds or mitigation?

_Did you find a workaround? What failed?_

### ⏱️ Quantify time lost or productivity impact

_Estimate (if known)._

### 💡 Any suggestions?
```

## 🚀 What Happens Next

- All submissions are reviewed by the **DevEx SubGroup** during our weekly meeting
- Items will be:
  - Clarified if needed
  - Tagged by category (e.g. `cognitive-friction`, `access-friction`, `delivery-friction`)
  - Prioritized by impact and effort
- We will track status updates and resolutions transparently via GitHub
- We will work with the appropriate team to get the issue prioritrized on their backlog

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- We value **engineer experience as a product**
- Friction is often a signal, not a failure
- Collaboration and empathy across teams will help us build something great
- This log is a **safe space** — all constructive feedback is welcome

## ❤️ Part of Our DevEx Vision

This effort is one component of our broader **Developer Experience initiative**, which is focused on:

- Reducing delivery, access, and cognitive friction
- Shortening time to onboarding and flow
- Enabling modern tools, documentation, and support
- Building a world-class environment to **attract and retain top talent**

Thanks for being part of the journey to make our engineering experience the best it can be 🚀
